String functions and String iterators

concepts to learn:
	- array of pointers : *a[5] --> need to see from c++ point of view

iterators:
	- if we are going with .begin and .end --> printing *with variable name
	- if we are going with auto i : variable name then use without *

Reference prints:
//cout << "i is \n";
//for(i=0; i<5; i++)
//cout << a[i] << "\t";
